# Welcome to Hako Live

https://hakolive.vercel.app

## What is Hako?

Hako is a small (physically - it's a small shop) Craft Beer shop in Winterthur (the 5/6th biggest city in small Switzerland). While they are still open in these times of COVID, they can't run their usual in-store digestation and have resorted to sending out a hars√© of 10 beers and holding a Zoom meetup about once a month (fun times!).

## But what is this repo for?

As a web nerd I decided to hack together some kind of mashup between the beers that Hako picks for the session and Untappd (a very popular beer-drinking social network).

## Why?

Well, I wanted too!?!

AND I'm applying for a job at a workplace that has React and Next.js requirements which I don't yet have... time for some JIT coding - I also noticed that their own website is hosted on [vercel.app](https://vercel.app/) which provides free hosting - see the output at https://hakolive.vercel.app
